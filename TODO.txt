TODO
    * do not allow amounts to be zero, as this messes up figuring out reverse amounts 1/n
    * figure out a more efficient algorithm for constraint propagation
    * If we have MULTIPLE measurements of a thing, use the MOST APPROPRIATE ONE (closest to 1.0)
    * handle plurals
        calory <-> calories
        apple <-> apples
        glass <-> glasses
    * adding rules should overwrite existing things, not just add to them (but also warning to user)
    * give warnings if user may have forgotten the 'of' keyword
    * give warnings if item not in vocabulary on query/infer
    * can we have multi-word units of measure, e.g. "fluid ounces"?
    * detect cycles and warn user
    * detect repetitive entries
    * add entries to the "database" (currently data.txt)
    * Be able to make aliases (e.g. "vitamin c is a vitamin")
        > vitamins => vitamin c, vitamin k
        > vitamins in 1 lbs of steak
            (no matches)
        > vitamin c in 1 lbs of steak
            (no matches)
        > vitamin k in 1 lbs of steak
            vitamin k: 9.07 mcg
